## Sensing and Acquisition

Two kinds of signals: event-related potentials and oscillatory processes. We're interested in event-related potentials.

Widely-scattered neural populations don't exhibit synchrony, but close-by (order of 1cm) there is more likelihood for synchrony.

Some electromagnetic fields can cancel each other out (e.g. the Amygdala).

Motor cortex (precentral gyrus) will show up over the ears, frontal lobe/prefrontal lobe (higher function) will show up on the forehead.

Singal neurons show spiking behavior (firing behavior might encode output signal).  The EEG is an average of millions of processes, but we might see modes at higher frequencies which come from spiking and lower frequences from background synchronicity, and then there's noise.

Average many instances of the same brain process to make the noise cancel itself out; this is how we get ERPs.

We see different signals for expected vs. unexpected signals.  

Single-trial ERPs are much harder to identify.  This requires pattern recognition and machine learning, and we usually need to integrate multiple time series.

Oscillatory processes (low to high frequency): delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma.

Alpha: sensory areas and motor areas exhibit strong alpha-band oscillations wehn idle in most subjects.

We see correlation between the different channels when we separate into statistically independent components which sum to generate the signal. We see that one independent component is spiking at regular intervals: that's blinking.  

Event-related coherence between two signal components.  Some moments they have high power at the same time, some they're phase-locked, some they're out of phase.  We can observe this phenomenon and see if there's information in there.

Effective connectivity: sophisticated measure of interaction between mutliple signals "information flow".

Signals are digitized by amplification and low-pass filtered, then digitally sampled.  We know that it's low-pass filtered even if it looks like a step function; there's a highest frequency you care about and you filter right below that.

We can exactly reconstruct the signal using interpolation (Nyquist Sampling Theorem).

## Signal processing

Linear time invariant systems and more complicated approaches to statistical signal procecessing.

A brain-computer interfaces transdocues the input signal x(n) into a control signal y(n).

BCIs are usual nonlinear, and they usually are multi-rate systems.

# Static Filters

Squaring the signal is useful for calculating the variance of the system, another useful one is the logarithm.

Spatial filters: transform a multi-channel signal X(n) such that each Y(n) depends only on X(n); most are linear, so that Y(n) = MX(n).  They can invert volumne conduction and remap channel signals to approximate source signals (this is their main use in BCIs).

Ex: re-referencing, ICA, common spatial patterns, surface Laplacian (subtract local  signal from its neighbors').  

Temporal filters are orthogonal to spatial filters in some sense.  Moving average is a smoothing operator, a temporal filter, and in fact a spectral filter.  It's hard to control what it retains.

Spectral filters are designed for their effect on the spectrum (a representation of the signal as a sum of sinusouids).  We could also use the Fourier series represetnation.

Spectral filters include high-pass, low-pass, band-pass.  We can isolate oscillations or ERPs of interest.

Finite impulse response filter: performs a convolution between the signal and the kernel (but the trick is the "kernel" coefficients b_k.

Different frequencies in the construction of low-pass filters have different lags.  

# A simple Neurofeedback BCI

We want to feed back the amplitude of a brain idle oscillation to the user/subject.  Band-pass in the 8-13 hz range, squaring, moving average, then take the square root or logarithm.

# Prediction functions
We view a limited-memory BCI as a mathematical mmapping from input to output where the output could be binary (excited/not excited).  There's an arbitrary functional form with unknown parameters.  The question is how to figure out what those parameters are.

Functional form should reflect relationship between observation and desired output.

These two frameworks are often used in combination: we can query the prediciton function on demand; the costly spectral filtering is done in the signal processing portion and we do the predictive mapping at lower rate in the functional portion.  In this way, the BCI is an oracle that consumes one or more signals and can respond to queries about a pre-defined question.
